# politicalvalues.github.io
A brief project I created as a proof-of-concept for a modular quiz. Everything inside the
project is designed to be easily editable and it's not difficult to create your own quiz based
on the code here.

## Creating your own
1. Fork the repo
2. Edit
  a. js/options.js
  b. js/questions.js
  - to accurately reflect the changes you wish to make
3. That's really it, it's not difficult

## Help
Note that I didn't create this to provide everybody with help, and to be entirely honest, I probably won't,
because this was really just a small side project I wanted to complete within a day, but everything inside of this
should be pretty easy to figure out, and, well, if it's not, you're out of luck.
