                what is politicalvalues?
                <p class="text">
                    politicalvalues is a political test inspired by the <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a> test,
                    as well as the <a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/">political compass</a> test. this is a test which asks you
                    several questions and then attempts to align you with some political 'values,' such as how right-wing, left-wing,
                    authoritarian, libertarian, economic, international, and progressive you are, as well as some other axes listed below.

                how are my results determined?
                <p class="text">
                    every question is weighted slightly differently, and in the end, values behind certain questions are totalled and
                    your results are calculated and then displayed. <b>do you think the results are inaccurate?</b> please don't hesitate
                    to <a href="mailto:wobblyyyy@gmail.com">email me</a> and i'll try to improve politicalvalues.

                    all of the source code behind politicalvalues is available on our <a href="https://github.com/politicalvalues/politicalvalues.github.io">github repository</a>. there's nothing really too advanced going on here,
                    so you're on your own if you try to make your own fork of the quiz. it would be greatly appreciated if you link the original quiz
                    in any forks you make of it, thank you!
